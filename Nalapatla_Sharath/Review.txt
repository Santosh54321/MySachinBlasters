Being an author of the code that was required to be reviewed, I was assigned huge accountability. 
I analyzed the requirements for code and wrote it. 
I confirmed the mediator on a timely basis that within what time the code will be complete. According to my direction, the mediator was able to set the time for the meeting. 
While reader was reviewing the code, I answered various questions that arise in team memberâ€™s mind listening to it. 
We found some issues in the code. Scribe noted that issues and provided a list to me. I made corrections in it after the meeting.
